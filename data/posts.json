        "content": "Web development is an exciting journey that starts with understanding the three core technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\n\n## HTML - The Structure\nHTML (HyperText Markup Language) provides the structure for your web pages. It uses tags to define elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and links.\n\n## CSS - The Styling\nCSS (Cascading Style Sheets) handles the visual presentation of your HTML elements. You can control colors, fonts, layouts, and animations.\n\n## JavaScript - The Interactivity\nJavaScript brings your web pages to life with dynamic behavior, interactivity, and user engagement features.\n\n## Getting Started\n1. Set up a code editor like VS Code\n2. Create your first HTML file\n3. Add some basic styling with CSS\n4. Add interactivity with JavaScript\n\nStart with simple projects and gradually increase complexity as you learn more concepts.",
